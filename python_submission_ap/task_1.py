#   Step 1: Ask the user for their coursework mark (out of 60).
#       Step 1.1: Check if coursework mark is valid (between 0-60)
#           - If valid, continue to next step.
#           - If not valid, display error message and ask user to input mark again.
#   Step 2: Ask the user to input their prelim mark (out of 90).
#       Step 2.1: Check if prelim mark is valid (between 0-90)
#           - If valid, continue to next step.
#           - If not valid, display error message and ask user to input mark again.
#   Step 3: Add course mark and prelim mark for total.
#   Step 4: Get percentage by dividing total score by max possible score of 150 and multiplying by 100.
#   Step 5: Get grade based on percentage
#       If percentage is greater than or equal to 70 then the grade is "A".
#       If percentage is between 60 and 69 then the grade is "B"
#       If percentage is between 50 and 59 then the grade is "C"
#       If percentage is between 45 and 49 then the grade is "D"
#       If percentage is less than 45 then the grade is "No Grade".
#   Step 6: Display percentage and grade to user.
