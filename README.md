# **Software Development PDA Submission**

---

### **PLEASE NOTE**  
Tasks 3, 4, 6, and 7 are the only tasks that required code. Task 1 was written in a Python file as an algorithm. The other tasks were submitted on a different external portal, which is why only Tasks 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 have been uploaded.

## **Project Brief**

Your overall percentage grade in your SCQF level 6 Computing Science Course is devised by adding the coursework mark (out of 60) to the prelim mark (out of 90) and then calculating the percentage.

### **Grading System**  
- **A Grade**: ≥ 70%  
- **B Grade**: 60%–69%  
- **C Grade**: 50%–59%  
- **D Grade**: 45%–49%  
- **No Grade**: < 45%

**Grade Calculation Formula:**  
`Grade = ((coursework mark + prelim mark) * 100) / 150`

## **Tasks Overview**

### **Task 1: Algorithm Design**
- Write an algorithm using appropriate design notation to:
  - Input one student’s coursework mark and prelim mark.  
  - Calculate and display their percentage and grade.  
- **Requirements**:  
  - Show the data flow.  
  - Validate input.  

---

### **Task 2: Test Plan**
- Create a test plan to systematically test the program.
- **Requirements**:  
  - Include normal, extreme, and exceptional test data.

---

### **Task 3 & 4: Program Development**
- **Task 3**: Write a program based on your design.  
- **Task 4**: Enhance the program with:  
  - Subprograms and parameter passing.  
  - Meaningful variable names, internal commentary, and proper indentation.  

**Additional Notes**:  
Use internal commentary to explain:  
  - The purpose of subprograms.  
  - How parameter passing works.  

---

### **Task 5: Program Testing**
- Test the program using your test plan.  
- If necessary, make amendments to ensure correctness.

---

### **Task 6: Multi-Student Support**
- Modify the program to:  
  - Read the **name**, **coursework mark**, and **prelim mark** for all 15 students in the class from an external file provided by your assessor.  
- **Internal Commentary**:  
  - Explain how file operations work and their purpose.

---

### **Task 7: Additional Features**
- **Count Occurrences**:  
  - Modify the program to count how many **“A” passes** are in the class using the "Count Occurrences" standard algorithm.  
  - Add internal commentary to explain how this algorithm works.  

- **Find Max**:  
  - Modify the program to find the student with the **best percentage** in the class using the "Find Max" standard algorithm.  
  - Add internal commentary to describe how this algorithm works.  

---

## **File Structure**
- Task 1: Algorithm written in Python.  
- Tasks 3, 4, 6, 7: Program code files.  
- Tasks 2 and 5: Test plan and results submitted separately on an external portal.
